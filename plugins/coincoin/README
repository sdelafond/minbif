            LibPurple's CoinCoin Plugin
            ***************************

1. What is Coincoin?

This is a plugin for the purple library, which allow to connect to a DaCode
board, to read and send messages on it.

The default board used by prpl-coincoin is linuxfr.org/board, which popularized
this kind of chat among a few french communities.

Other softwares support this kind of board, like Templeet or Da Portative
Bouchot.

You can find a (non-exhaustive) list of boards on this page (look at the
"tribune" links):
http://chrisix.free.fr/pycoincoin/config/list.php

A board has an unique chat space, so prpl-coincoin creates at connection an
unique channel "board".

2. How to install it

Compile prpl-coincoin and copy the libcoincoin.so file to /usr/lib/purple-2/.

Then, use your favorite purple client (for example MinBif), and the module is
automatically loaded.

3. How to use it

Create a new account, and select the "CoinCoin" plugin. Then, you need to give
this settings:

* Username: your login[@server] on board (if the @server part is not given,
            defauts to linuxfr.org board)
* Password: locate your cookies for the website (from your browser), and put
            them here, separated by semi-colons (;)

Full example for a custom Da Portative Bouchot board:
	/MAP ADD coincoin ToTo@tribioune.mydomain.tld
	     -password md5=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;unique_id=yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
	     -board /remote.xml -post /index.php/add

4. You're connected

The *status* channel is always created in minbif, but always empty for coincoin
accounts, as this system as no presence information.

The *board* channel is automatically created, and you can chat!

5. Help for readability

Each totoz is colored in green, and clocks are colored in blue.

6. Clocks

Your purple client, unlike other coincoin clients, doesn't hilight referenced
message when you put your mouse on a timestamp. To increase readability,
prpl-coincoin adds the sender nickname of the referenced message before
the timestamp

For example, if there are two messages with timestamp:
	10:23:09 <blah> hey guys
	10:28:43 <ho> 10:23:09 f0ck you

the last message is replaced with:
	10:28:43 <ho> blah: 10:23:09 f0ck you

Also, when you write a message, to reference to a previous message, instead of
putting the timestamp, you can use the nickname, eventually suffixed with the
number of message from last.

For example:
	10:23:09 <blah> hey guys
	10:28:43 <ho> 10:23:09 f0ck you
	10:30:21 <blah> hey nigger

If you write:
	10:32:33 <me> blah:2: youhou hoÂ¹: you're bad

The message sent is:
	10:32:33 <me> 10:23:03 youhou 10:28:43 you're bad

Have fun.
